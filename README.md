# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a solution for the [StrataScratch Customer Churn Prediction Project](https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/customer-churn-prediction). The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and build a predictive model that forecasts customer churn using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The primary aim of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn so that effective retention strategies can be implemented. By analyzing historical customer data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying various classification algorithms, our solution provides actionable insights into key factors that drive customer churn.

## Project Description

This project entails the following steps:

- **Data Collection and Cleaning:**  
  Process the raw customer data by handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Uncover underlying patterns by visualizing customer demographics, usage trends, and service interactions.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Create new features and transform existing variables to improve model performance.

- **Modeling:**  
  Develop predictive models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and others. Evaluate model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

- **Insights and Recommendations:**  
  Identify key drivers of churn and provide recommendations for targeted customer retention strategies.
